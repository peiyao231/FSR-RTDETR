# FSR-RTDETR

This repository provides a minimal, reproducible implementation of **FSR-RTDETR**, built on **Ultralytics RT-DETR** with three plug-in modules:

- **FSAS**: frequency-selective feature enhancement and geometry-consistent sampling  
- **LGF**: learnable gated fusion for adjacent-level feature aggregation  
- **RMBConv**: re-parameterized multi-branch convolution for deployment-friendly inference
